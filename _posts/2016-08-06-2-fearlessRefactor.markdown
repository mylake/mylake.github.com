  * ##### Extract an adapter object
    * extract call external library to adapter object call

  * ##### Extract a repository object
    * hide the direct ActiveRecord calls, isolated, add data storage on repo object

  * ##### Extract a service object using the SimpleDelegator
    * move some domain or business logic to service object

  * ##### Extract conditional validation into Service Object
    * when validation only used in one place, drop the condition on model, move it to service object

  * ##### Extract a form object
    * move form to form object, more explicit and domain is expressed better
    * form object can't have save method (SRP), Persistence is a seperate concern and different object should take care of it, form object only valid data
