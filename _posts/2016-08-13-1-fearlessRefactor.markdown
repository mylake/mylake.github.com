    1. Value Objects: define domain-specific Value Objects,  Value Objects are great when you have an attribute or small group of attributes that have logic associated with them
    2. Service Objects: action is complex,  action reaches across multiple models, action interacts with an external service, action is not a core concern of the underlying model
    3. Form Objects: Virtus, When multiple ActiveRecord models might be updated by a single form submission, a Form Object can encapsulate the aggregation
    4. Query Objects: For complex SQL queries littering the definition of your ActiveRecord subclass
    5. View Objects: If logic is needed purely for display purposes, it does not belong in the model.
    6. Policy Objects: Sometimes complex read operations might deserve their own objects
      * “Service Object” for write operations and “Policy Object” for reads, Query Objects focus on executing SQL to return a result set
    7. Decorators: For cases where callback logic only needs to run in some circumstances or including it in the model would give the model too many responsibilities, a Decorator is useful

  * Refactoring recipes

     * Inline controller filters
         * extract filter to service

     * Explicitly render views with locals
         * pass the params to partials explicitly with render

     * Extract render/redirect methods
         * extract a private method for each render and redirect call

     * Extract a Single Action Controller class
         * extract like CreateProductsController only when ProductsController is too too too large

     * Extract routing constraint
         * use routing constraint to seperate controller action

     * Extract an adapter object
         * extract call external library to adapter object call

     * Extract a repository object
         * hide the direct ActiveRecord calls, isolated, add data storage on repo object

     * Extract a service object using the SimpleDelegator
         * move some domain or business logic to service object

     * Extract conditional validation into Service Object
         * when validation only used in one place, drop the condition on model, move it to service object

     * Extract a form object
         * move form to form object, more explicit and domain is expressed better
         * form object can't have save method (SRP), Persistence is a seperate concern and different object should take care of it, form object only valid data

  *  Patterns

     * Instantiating service objects
       *

     * The repository pattern
       *

     * Wrap external API with an adapter
         * isolated our interface from the implementation

     * 4 ways to early return from a rails controller

         * extracted_method; return if performed?

     * Service::Input
       *

     * Validations: Contexts
       *

     * Validations: Objectify
       *

  * Related topics

     * Service controller communication
         * True/false; return the object created/updated; return a response object that contains all the data and/or errors;
         * carry data through exceptions; controller passes callback methods;

     * Where to keep services
         * group your services according to the feature and then surround them with proper namespace
         * ex: Reporting::MonthlyReport, Forum::CreateNewTopic, TimeTracking::LogTimeService

     * Routing constraints
         * use routing constraints for situations where you need to choose differentctions based on some params
         * This makes the controller thinner and it’s more explicit what actios happening
